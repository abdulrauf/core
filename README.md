Gluttonberg Core
================

The Gluttonberg goal has always been to create a Content Management System that's great for users, content manager and developers. The focus of Gluttonberg 2.5 has been two-fold: a refined management user interface to make maintaining your website even easier and a change in the architecture of the system to support our new functionality modules: Events, TV, Mobile and soon eCommerce.
