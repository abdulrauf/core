  # i made this class for providing extra methods in file class.

  # keep in mind when we upload asset from browser, browser injects three extra attributes (that are given in MyFile class)
  # but we are adding assets from file, i am injecting extra attributes manually. because asset library assumes that file has three extra attributes
